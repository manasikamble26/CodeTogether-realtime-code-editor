# CodeTogether-realtime-code-editor

Contents 
Introduction : CodeTogether is a real-time collaborative code editor built using React, Node.js, Socket.io, and CodeMirror. It allows multiple users to collaboratively write and edit code simultaneously within a shared room. Designed as a solution for technical interviews, remote pair programming, and coding mentorship, it ensures low-latency updates and seamless collaboration.

Feutures : 
🔗 Create or join coding rooms via Room ID

✍️ Real-time code synchronization using WebSockets

👤 Display active participants in a room

📋 Copy Room ID to clipboard

🚪 Leave Room functionality

📝 Syntax-highlighted code editor powered by CodeMirror

💾 Download Code (coming soon)

💡 Future Scope: Code execution engine, language support switcher, chat system, and code history/versioning

🧠 Project Inspiration : 
This project was inspired during my preparation for online coding interviews. Many companies ask candidates to write code in Google Docs while sharing their screen, which is far from ideal for assessing real-time coding abilities. I envisioned a tool that would enable interviewers and candidates to collaborate live on code, just like a whiteboard session — and that became the foundation of CodeTogether.

🙏 Acknowledgements
Special thanks to CodersGyan for the original inspiration and guidance. The foundational structure and WebSocket-based real-time code sharing mechanism were influenced by his tutorials. This project was further extended with additional features and improvements to suit real-world interview and collaboration scenarios.
